# Data

## Data sources

SHFDB version 4.2.2 is used that links the following Swedish registers through the 
Swedish personal identity number (PIN)[@pin]: 

{{< include src/datasources.qmd >}}

## Variable definitions

{{< include src/vars.qmd >}}

More information on data sources, definitions etc. are found https://kiheartfailure.github.io/shfdb4/.

## Inclusion/exclusion criteria

```{r}
#| label: tbl-flow
#| tbl-cap: Information for flowchart
#| tbl-pos: "H"

default_kable(flow) %>%
  row_spec(c(1, 11), bold = T)
```

First patient in: `r min(rsdata$shf_indexdtm)` and last patient in: `r max(rsdata$shf_indexdtm)` 
from approximately `r rsdata %>% distinct(shf_centre) %>% count() %>% pull(n)` enrolling centers. 

Baseline is date of visits or date of discharge for the visit/hospitalization recorded in SwedeHF. 

## Acknowledgments

Please include "We thank all staff members at care units reporting into the SwedeHF registry for their contribution." 
in the Acknowledgements of any resulting articles. 

## Ethics and Informed consent

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 2021-04326. 
Individual consent was not required, but patients were informed of entry into SwedeHF and able to opt‐out.

# Statistical analysis 

## General

All analyses were performed using `r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string` [@r]. 
The level of significance is set to 5%, two-sided. No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons were made and therefore the results should be viewed with care.

## Baseline characteristics

Categorical variables are presented with n and percentage and tested for 
differences between patients eligible and not eligible for advanced HF therapy with the chi-square test. 
Continuous variables are presented with median [first quartile-third quartile] and tested for 
differences between patients eligible and not eligible for advanced HF therapy with the Kruskal-Wallis test. 

## Trends in patients eligible for AdvHF therapies and selected baseline characteristics

Trends in the proportion of patients eligible for AdvHF therapies as well as patients in each age group, sex and GDMT are presented descriptively. 

## Trends in 1 year outcomes

The following outcomes are considered: 

- `r outvars$name[1]`
- `r outvars$name[2]`
- `r outvars$name[3]`
- `r outvars$name[4]`
- `r outvars$name[5]`

Time trends will be calculated by dividing the number of first events per patient-years and presented as events per 100 person-years with Poisson rate 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
To identify possible mediators of potential time trends, standardized incidence rates will be obtained by Poisson regression, partly crude and partly adjusting for age and sex. 
The estimated annual percent change (eAPC) was also calculated using Poisson regression. 

For LVAD only years from 2015 are presented due to the change of operation codes this year. 

## Sensitivity analysis

2015 the coding procedure for LVAD changed and the LVAD definition is not completely comparable before and after 2015. 
We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for selected analyses not excluding patients with previous LVAD in order to see if this had an effect in the time trends.

# Results

```{r}
med <- rsdata %>%
  summarise(
    med = fn(median(shf_age), dig = 0),
    q1 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.25), dig = 0),
    q3 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.75), dig = 0)
  ) %>%
  mutate(out = paste0(med, " (", q1, "-", q3, ")")) %>%
  pull(out)

percfem <- rsdata %>%
  count(shf_sex) %>%
  mutate(perc = fn(n / sum(n) * 100, 0)) %>%
  filter(shf_sex == "Female") %>%
  pull(perc)
```

The median (q1-q3) age is `r med` and `r percfem`% females.
